# ðŸŒ€ Trackit â€” React Ticket & Task Management App

Trackit is a responsive, modern ticket and task management interface built with React 18, Vite, Typescript and Tailwind CSS .  
It provides a seamless experience for creating, tracking, and updating tickets in real-time â€” all stored locally in the browser for simplicity and speed.

- Task/Ticket dashboard for managing items  
- Local state persistence using the browserâ€™s `localStorage`

###  Functional Ticket Management

 this stage adds:

- **Dynamic Ticket System:** Create, edit, and delete tasks with automatic updates.  
- **Persistent State:** All tickets are saved using `localStorage`.  
- **Priority & Status Controls:** Each ticket includes priority levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and status options (`open`, `in_progress`, `closed`).  
- **Reusable Components:** Cards, modals, and UI parts are fully modular.
